### what is this project even?
well, it's my take on raycasting. I kinda reverse engineered this based on how
I though it could work. Code quality is terrible, but it is what it is, I might
clean it unless I find new project.

### what works
- keyboard movement (wsad)
- mouse
- that's it xD

### what does not work
- textures
- sound
- dynamic level generation


### dependencies
- SDL3

### supported platforms
- anything that has c compiler and SDL3 (if you don't have bash you have to build it yourself tho)
